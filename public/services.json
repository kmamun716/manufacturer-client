    "description": "Metal fabrication processes are often an effective way to generate a given product, however, one needs additional modern tools to achieve a high level of specificity and uniformity. To do so, machining tools can be used to selectively remove or finish a piece of metal or metal-based product. Modern machine tools are traditionally powered by electricity; additional automation of the machining process can be achieved by employing a CNC machine tool, guided by computer programming. The major benefit of modern machining tools is the exceptional uniformity they deliver when manufacturing numerous products with identical parameters and requirements. Many modern machining tools are merely improvements on manual machining tools that have been around for centuries. Other relatively new designs are possible because of recent advancements in technology.",
